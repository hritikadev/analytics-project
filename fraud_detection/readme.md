Using an unbalanced dataset from kaggle tried to make a prediction model which predicts whether the transaction is fraud or not.
The dataset had mostly the datapoints of not fraud transactions so the results had high chances of being skewed              

Also, tried to edit the dataset to make it balanaced and run the prediction again.
